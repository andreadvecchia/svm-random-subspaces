## Overview
This repository contains simulation code and experiments for studying kernel-based regularized empirical risk minimization (ERM) on random subspaces, with a particular emphasis on the NystrÃ¶m approximation.

Our work investigates the statisticalâ€“computational trade-offs that arise when applying convex (and possibly non-differentiable) loss functions, such as the hinge loss for classification. The methodology is designed for scalability in high-dimensional settings, delivering significant memory and runtime savings while maintaining optimal performance.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreadvecchia/svm-random-subspaces.git
cd svm-random-subspaces
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
You can reproduce the experiments from the paper with:

```bash
python scripts/run_experiments.py --dataset synthetic --loss hinge --subspace nystrom
```

To plot the results:
```bash
python scripts/plot_results.py --input results/exp1.csv
```

(We will update the available options once the scripts are fully cleaned.)

## Quickstart (Demo Notebook)

Open **`notebooks/demo_experiment.ipynb`** and run all cells to see Randomâ€‘Subspace SVM vs. a baseline SVM on a synthetic highâ€‘dimensional dataset. The demo is selfâ€‘contained and finishes in a few seconds.

## Python API

```python

from svm_random_subspaces import RandomSubspaceSVM

model = RandomSubspaceSVM(M=25, k=20, random_state=7)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

```
